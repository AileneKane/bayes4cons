Analyses of trends in literature

1) Started with journals selected in Ellison paper, as part of goal is to compare changes in recent decade with his analysis

2) Added two journals as indicators of trends in forestry and fisheries conservation/ecology (two large sectors of conservation/natural resource management) as we wanted to also compare trends by subdiscipline. To identify commonly used journals in these two fields, we conducted a web of science search for topic = forest* AND ecology OR topic = forest* AND conservation on May 14, 2024. This resulted in 10,923 Articles, Review articles and data papers from 1953-2024. The publication titles with the highest numbers of articles were BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION (406) and FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT (340). We selected FEM, as a field-specific journal. 

For Fisheries, we conducted a similar search web of science search for topic = fish* AND ecology OR topic = fish* AND conservation on May 14, 2024 and found 5,586 Articles, Review articles and data papers from 1936-2024. Publications with the highest number of articles were Marine Ecology Progress Series (201) and Aquatic Conservation Marine and Freswhater Ecosystems (186)
