	abstract = {Question: Do realistic models predict that infectious disease will select for altered life histories? Specifically, under what conditions can trophic disease transmission influence life-history evolution in tiger salamanders by selecting against cannibalistic morphs? Data: Previous information from laboratory and field studies on Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum populations from the Kaibab Plateau and Mogollon Rim regions of northern Arizona. Features of model: Differential equation model incorporating ecological, epidemiological, and genetic structure of tiger salamander populations. Conclusions: The model can replicate observed patterns of density, phenotypic and genotypic frequency of cannibal morphs, but only by assuming very high disease levels. Disease-induced mortality of both aquatic and terrestrial adults is necessary to reduce the genotypic frequency of cannibalism to observed levels. Given the high forces of infection required to reduce genetic propensity towards cannibalism, other life-history trade-offs may also constrain the genotypic frequency of cannibalism in tiger salamanders. More generally, cannibalism and infectious disease,may interfere with each other by reducing population densities, limiting disease-induced selection against cannibalism.},

	abstract = {Ecologists often use nonlinear fitting techniques to estimate the parameters of complex ecological models, with attendant frustration. This paper compares three open-source model fitting tools and discusses general strategies for defining and fitting models. R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn, AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve, while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed. Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https://groups-nceas-ucsb-edu.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/nonlinear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.},
